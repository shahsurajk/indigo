Hello! If you've made it till here, then I'm sure you're interested in knowing more about me! &#x1f37b;

I am a Software Engineer at [QTalk](qtalk.io). I write Kotlin, Java, GoLang and keep on scanning Github for Rust projects to read and know about.

I like programming and clicking landscape photos. I also go on Himalyan treks once every year.

This blog is open-sourced, in case you wish to make something for yourself and don't know how to write JS/HTML/CSS!
